# Credit_Risk_classification
I built a model based off of lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company  to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 
answers to questions in jupyter notebook:
The logistic regression model predicts at a extrememly successful rate for 'healthy loan' class.
The precision for the 1 class was 1.0, which means that the model correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations (rounding up from 99.6) 100% of the time. 
The recal was .99 which meant that the model correctly correctly predicted positive observations to all predicted observations for that high-risk loan class 99% of the time.

For the high-risk loan class wasn't as good as the healthy loan class. 
The precision for the 1 class was 84%, which means that the model correctly 
predicted positive observations to th 
total predicted positi e observatio 84% of the times.
T the recal was .94 which meant that the model correctly correctly 
predicted positive observations to al 
predicted observations for thahigh-risk loan class 94% of the tim

I would have liked to have seen the model have a higher precision on the High-Risk loans, that would be what worries me most as a bank lender, Im glad we had such a high accuracy on the healthy loans. However, the model has a 99% accuracy, which means it correctly predicted healthy and high risk loans 99% of the time. That does give me confidence that the model is working and I can trust it.ss.
